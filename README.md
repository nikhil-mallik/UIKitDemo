# UIKit Demo Project for Learning Purposes

## Overview
This project is a UIKit demo application designed to provide learners with a practical understanding of various UIKit components and architectural patterns. The application covers essential concepts such as user authentication, data fetching, UI updates, and navigation within an iOS app. The app is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to clearly separate concerns and facilitate efficient data binding and user interaction.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials. The app includes error handling for invalid login attempts.
   - **Registration**: New users can register by providing their details. The registration process includes validation and error handling.

2. **Data Display**
   - **Browse Data**: Users can browse a list of items (e.g., products). Each item is displayed with its image, title, category, price, and rating.
   - **Item Details**: Users can view detailed information about an item, including a larger image, description, and like/unlike functionality.

3. **User Profile**
   - **Profile Management**: Users can view and manage their profile information, including their name and authentication token.

4. **Logout**
   - **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out to clear their session and redirect them to the login screen.

5. **Country Selection**
   - **Country Dropdown**: Allows users to select a country from a dropdown list.
   - **State Dropdown**: Displays states based on the selected country.
   - **City Dropdown**: Shows cities based on the selected state.
   - **Search Functionality**: Integrates `UISearchBar` into the table views for country, state, and city selection, enabling users to filter items based on their names.

6. **Image Management**
   - **Add Images**: Users can add images to a scrollable view, which can be displayed either in a list or grid layout.
   - **Full-Screen View**: Users can view images in full-screen mode with gestures like swipe, double-tap, and pinch to zoom.

7. **Counter Functionality**
   - **Increment and Decrement:** Users can increment or decrement a counter value using buttons.
   - **Data Binding:** The counter value is dynamically updated in the UI using KVO.Navigation

8. **Local Notifications**
   - **Scheduled Notifications:** Users can schedule local notifications to be triggered at a specified time.
   - **Expiry Notifications:** The app will push local notifications one day before an item expires and on the day of expiry.

9. **CRUD with Core Data**
   - **Food Demo CRUD:** Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on food items, with core data integration. This includes notifications for item expiry.

10. **Map Integration**

   - **Google Maps and Apple Maps:** Users can view and interact with locations on both Google Maps and Apple Maps.

11. **Biometric Authentication**
   - **Face ID/Touch ID:** Provides an additional layer of security through biometric authentication.

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
  - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic (e.g., `LoginModel`, `LoginResponseModel`, `RegisterModel`, `UserListModel`, `ProductListModel`).
  - **ViewModel**: Manages the data for the view and handles business logic (e.g., `LoginViewModel`, `RegisterViewModel`, `UserListViewModel`, `ProductListViewModel`, `CollectionViewModel`).
  - **View**: The user interface components (e.g., `LoginViewController`, `RegisterViewController`, `ProductListViewController` etc).

- **Networking**
  - **API Manager**: A singleton class that handles API requests and responses using URLSession. It includes methods for making GET and POST requests and handles common headers and error responses.
  - **Endpoints**: Defined in the `APIEndPoint` enum, which conforms to the `EndPointType` protocol. This includes paths, base URLs, methods, and request bodies for various API calls (e.g., login, register, fetch items, fetch users).

- **UI Components**
  - **Custom Views**: Includes styled text fields and buttons, managed by the `Utility` class for consistent UI styling.
  - **Collection View**: Displays a grid of items with custom sizing and layout.
  - **Table View**: Used for displaying user lists.
  - **Dropdowns**: Utilizes UITableViews embedded in dropdown views (`countryTableViewOutlet`, `stateTableViewOutlet`, `cityTableViewOutlet`) to display selectable items.
  - **Labels and Buttons**: Updates UI elements (`selectedCountryNameLbl`, `selectedStateNameLbl`, `selectedCityNameLbl`, `allSelectedFieldLbl`) based on user selection.
  - **Search Bar**: Adds a `UISearchBar` to the table view headers for filtering country, state, and city names.
  - **Scroll Views**: Manages the layout and display of images in scroll views (`UserImageScrollViewController`).
  - **Image Gestures**: Provides full-screen image viewing with swipe, double-tap, and pinch-to-zoom gestures (`FullScreenImageViewControllers`).
  - **Collection View Cell xib**: Custom cell designs for `CollectionViewCell` to display product images and other data.
  - **Table View Cell xib**: Custom cell designs for `TableViewCell` to display detailed information in a structured format.
  - **Custom Text Field**: CustomUITextField class prevents users from pasting text into certain text fields.
  - **Loader Views**: LoaderViewHelper class provides methods to show and hide loading indicators on views and buttons.

- **Data Binding**
  - **Event Handling**: The ViewModels use closures to handle events such as loading, data loaded, errors, and navigation. This allows for reactive updates to the UI based on the state of the data.
  - **Combine Framework**: Uses Combine publishers and subscribers (`@Published`, `sink`) in the ViewModel to update UI components reactively.

## Improvements

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Integrated UISearchBar to filter the data displayed in the table views for countries, states, and cities
   - Implemented functions to filter data based on the search text and show filtered results in the table view.
   - Added functionality to clear the search bar and display original data when the search bar is empty.
   - Made the search bar the table header for each table view.

2. **Code Performance and Readability**:
   - Reduced the number of API calls by optimizing data fetching strategies.
   - Broke down long functions into smaller, more manageable ones for better readability and maintainability.
   - Added comments and MARK directives to organize code sections and improve readability.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Added a custom loader to show during data loading, enhancing user experience.
   - Displayed error messages when data fetching fails, providing feedback to users.
   - Implemented a global custom loader class for UIView and UIButton to standardize the loading experience across the app.
